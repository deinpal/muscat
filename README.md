# muscat
MUSCAT is a QGIS plugin designed to simulate and analyze urban land use/land cover (LULC) changes using Markov chain models. It provides an intuitive interface for researchers, planners, and geospatial analysts to run land use change simulations, assess transition probabilities, and validate model outputs against real-world data.
